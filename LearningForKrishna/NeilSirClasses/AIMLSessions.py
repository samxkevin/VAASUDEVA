"""The Whole world is an equation. We have a variables,weights(Coefficients of the variable) and Linearity(Degree of an equation) and the result of the relation of all 
these things together. AI is the thing which is parametrizing everything in the world. Visualize these variables, weights as a matrix ad add the Linearity to it.
Which will add us to a sensible equation. GPU's are fast matrix calculators so they are being used in the field of AI. Seamingly unconnected stuff is not really 
unconnected until we have an equation. The world is going to a field called Hypercustomization.

ANN- Artificial Neural Network. Hidden Layers are also called as Black-Box. Gaussian Distribution. Probablity Distribution Function, Derivatives important topics
in this case.  If we have to be great in AI we have to be intimate with maths. We have to improve the grounding in math. Intractable Problem: y has no relationship with x.
We have an assumed function and training data for it. give input for that. compare that with the actual results. There will be errors. With that error, change the 
parameters of the assumed function. Repeat this for accurate and precise results(EPOC).

"""Jupyter notebook is a python interpretor which is widely used in Deep Learning Applications. Loss Function- We will never get correct output.Initiallly we do not know the ways so we start with random weights which result in y now we give that x and predict that y which is in lot of variation with ground one. The difference between the actual value and the predicted value for y is called the Loss Variable. We use cross entropy for benign or malignity of the function for classification of the error.
AI is an attempt to decrease the loss function to a bare minimum."""
