"""The Whole world is an equation. We have a variables,weights(Coefficients of the variable) and Linearity(Degree of an equation) and the result of the relation of all 
these things together. AI is the thing which is parametrizing everything in the world. Visualize these variables, weights as a matrix ad add the Linearity to it.
Which will add us to a sensible equation. GPU's are fast matrix calculators so they are being used in the field of AI. Seamingly unconnected stuff is not really 
unconnected until we have an equation. The world is going to a field called Hypercustomization.

ANN- Artificial Neural Network. Hidden Layers are also called as Black-Box. Gaussian Distribution. Probablity Distribution Function, Derivatives important topics
in this case.  If we have to be great in AI we have to intimate with maths. We have to improve the grounding in math.
