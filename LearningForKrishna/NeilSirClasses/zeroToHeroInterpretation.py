#This Has been created upon the recommendation by Neil sir to go throught the Andrej Kaparthy video regarding Neural Networks.
#Interpretation For the first video: The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd

"""Jupyter notebooks are very important in this case. We are going to 
start with blank jupyter notebook. Micrograd is a library, a tiny Autograd 
engine (short term for automamatic gradient) which implements backpropagation. 
Backpropagation is an algorithm that allows us to evaluate the gradient of 
loss function by repeatedly tuning the weights of the neural network with 
which we improve the accuracy of the network. Therefore Backpropagation
acts as the mathematical base or core of ny modern deep neural network library
like say pytorch. Micrograd can be best illustrated by an example. Micrograd
helps us build out mathematical expressions. """
