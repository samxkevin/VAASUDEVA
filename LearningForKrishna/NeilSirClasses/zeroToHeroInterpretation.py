#This Has been created upon the recommendation by Neil sir to go throught the Andrej Kaparthy video regarding Neural Networks.
#Interpretation For the first video: The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd
"""Jupiter notebooks are very important in this case. We are going to start with blank jupyter notebook. Micrograd is a library, a tiny Autograd engine (short term for 
automamatic gradient) which implements backpropagation."""
