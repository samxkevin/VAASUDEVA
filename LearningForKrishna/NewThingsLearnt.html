Notes from freecodecamp's certification shall be written here:
To ensure your `<p>` element with the text `% Daily Value *` has the `no-divider` class without removing the existing classes, you should
update the class attribute properly. In HTML, class names should be space-separated, and there should be no commas within the class gattribute.
Hereâ€™s how you can fix it:
Correct Code:
html
<div class="daily-value small-text">
  <p class="bold right no-divider">% Daily Value *</p>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p><span><span class="bold">Total Fat</span> 8g</span> <span class="bold">10%</span></p>
  <p class="indent no-divider">Saturated Fat 1g <span class="bold">5%</span></p>
</div>
Changes:
1. In the class attribute of the first `<p>` tag, I removed the comma and added `no-divider` correctly as:html
   class="bold right no-divider
2.Similarly, for the second `<p>` with the `class="indent no-divider"`, the comma was removed.
Now, the classes should work as expected.
