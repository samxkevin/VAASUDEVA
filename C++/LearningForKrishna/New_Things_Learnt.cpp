//learn about ordered set and unordered set,
/*
I understood that ordered set is more conscious about the order of the set and not on what all elements are getting added to the set... but unordered set focuses more on the elements we are adding to the set and not on the order of them.
So unordered set comes more handy when we want to do operations like union, intersection and difference.
