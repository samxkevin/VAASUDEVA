#Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable, a sequence of immutable python objects. They are sequences like lists(mutable).
#Data Structure: Arranging data in a manner for simplicity and efficiency
#lists use square brackets... but tuple use parenthesis...
#Tuple, list, set, dictionary are built-in data types(class).

""" â€¢ Add, multiply.

A tuple is not a number. But it can be added to or multiplied.

By adding two tuples, they are concatenated. One is put after the other.

And:By multiplying a tuple with a number, we add the tuple to itself a certain number of times.

Divide, subtract. We cannot divide or subtract tuples. """
